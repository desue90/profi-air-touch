# ToDo

[ ] Update README.md to new version updates

[ ] Remove Turn On/Off from Entity (at the moment this is displayed, but don't know why)

[ ] Create sensors out of information from status.xml. Create one for current ventilation level and assign it to the fan entity

[ ] Add Icons for the available preset modes, e.g. mdi:fan-speed-1, *-2, *-3 and mdi:rocket:launch, as soon as this feature exists. See https://community.home-assistant.io/t/new-thermostat-card-preset-icons/652861
-> According to "Icon Translation", see:
https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/core/entity#icon-translations
Icons for entity state attributes can be provided.
Examples include fan modes
* I've added an icons.json according to the description, but it doesn't work

[ ] Add check, if entered IP address is valid
