# ToDo

[ ] Translations for preset modes!?:
 - level 1: "Humidity suppression"
 - level 2: "Absent"
 - level 3: "Living"
 - level 4: "Party"

[ ] Remove Turn On/Off from Entity (at the moment this is displayed, but don't know why)

[ ] Set preset mode from "Party" to last preset mode after time x

[ ] Check if there is anything else, that can be remote controlled via HTTP requests

[ ] Add Icons for the available preset modes, e.g. mdi:fan-speed-1, *-2, *-3 and mdi:rocket:launch, as soon as this feature exists. See https://community.home-assistant.io/t/new-thermostat-card-preset-icons/652861
