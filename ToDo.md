# ToDo

* Translations for preset modes!?:
1: "Humidity suppression"
2: "Absent"
3: "Living"
4: "Party"
* Remove Turn On/Off from Entity (at the moment this is displayed, but don't know why)
* Set preset mode from "Party" to last preset mode after time x
* Check if there is anything else, that can be remote controlled via HTTP requests
